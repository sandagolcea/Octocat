$ git branch
# to list all available branches (and point to your current branch)

$ git branch <new_branch>
# to create branch called <new_branch>

$ git checkout <branch_name>
# to move to a different branch

Why?
You create branches when you want to deviate from the main (master) repository.
Either you want to make some changes, add things, remove things or explore new possibilities.
What?
A branch is basicaly a deviation from your project. 
e.g.: you master + whatever experiment(feature) you had in mind.
